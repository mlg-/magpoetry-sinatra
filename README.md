# Magnetic Poetry

This app riffs off of a small script I made as a final project for CSCI-E3 at
Harvard Extension School in Spring 2015. Rather than use JavaScript to make API
calls (insecure/exposes the private key), it populates a local database with
certain kinds of words (using the Wordnik API) and then uses an internal API
with the JavaScript via ajax.
