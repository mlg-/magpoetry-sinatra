# Magnetic Poetry

## "The internet is your fridge." (thanks, Brian Fink, haha.)

Building off a small JavaScript I wrote, this version of the magnetic poetry
app has a database backing it. I practiced creating a seed file, setting up
a simple GET API interface, and using Ajax to communicate with my db.
